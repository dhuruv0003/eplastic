        E Plastic management system is a website where we are use to recycle the waste plastic. It is very
        helpful in order to overcome the wastage issues of the
        plastics. The user can able to view the list of plastic
        categories based on their shapes they can choose any of it.
        The admin used to maintain all the records. Admin also
        can view the users details add details of product and can
        also able to update the changes in the details. The
        management and recycling of E plastic waste is rapidly
        growing as it is a valuable resource of industries and it is
        very substances and with low recycling rate. The
        Utilization of e plastic waste materials is a partial solution
        to environmental and ecological problems. As the use of E
        plastic waste will reduces the Aggregate cost and provides
        a good strength for the structures and roads. It will reduces
        the landfill cost and it is energy saving. The e plastic waste
        consists of discarded plastic waste; these plastics are nonbiodegradable components of E plastic waste as a partial
        replacement of the coarse or fine aggregates. Plastic
        pollution is generated by the unsustainable use and
        disposal of plastic products in modern society, threatening
        economies, ecosystems, and human health. Current cleanup strategies have attempted to mitigate the negative
        effects of plastic pollution but are unable to compete with
        increasing quantities of plastic entering the environment.
        Thus, reducing inputs of plastic to the environment must
        be prioritized through a global multidisciplinary approach.
        Mismanaged waste is a major land-based source of plastic
        pollution that can be reduced through improvements in the
        life-cycle of plastics, especially in production,
        consumption, and disposal, through an Integrated Waste
        Management System.
